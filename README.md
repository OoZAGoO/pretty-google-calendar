## Frequently Asked Questions

### What sorcery is this?!

Pretty Google Calendar impliments the excellent [Full Calendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) for you, taking all the pain and anquish away.

### Can I use this to manage a calendar?

Not directly. All calendar events are maintaned via Google Calendar, this plugin just displays them in a non shitty way.

### How do I theme the calendar?

Add custom css to your theme to tweak to your desire.

### Can this plugin do X,Y or Z?

Probably not. But it maybe could!

Pretty Google Caledar is purposefully simple and easy, and set up with a few defaults to make things just work. However, there may be a killer feature you want that others are clammering for.

Since it is based on Full Calendar, theoretically, anything that is possible there, is possible here Contact me for requests for additional functionality, and let's see what we can create together!
